# UltraSim client application project

This is the one maintained Godot application and the only production Godot script assembly. Its
`Adapter/`, `Shell/`, and conditionally compiled `Local/` sources replace the former `_Godot`,
`Bootstrap.Godot`, `Local.Godot`, and `Playable.Godot` projects. Keeping all native scripts in
`UltraSim.Client.Application.Godot` avoids duplicate Godot type registration during editor reload.
Only the scene-attached `ClientHost.cs` is imported as a Godot script. Internal adapter, shell, and
local-play C# sources are `.gdignore`d from Godot's resource scanner while continuing to compile
into that same assembly; this prevents inherited native base types from being registered again
during editor hot reload. The build also keeps only the active Debug/Release copy of the sole script
assembly in the live development tree.

The `UltraSimEdition` MSBuild property creates three physically different dependency products from
the same scene, settings, input surface, import database, and presentation assets:

```text
SinglePlayer
    Client Core + Client.Local + built-in local content + Godot wrapper
    no Client.Network / Game.Protocol / Network kernel

Online
    Client Core + Client.Network + Godot wrapper
    no Client.Local / local Game composition / Server Runtime

Complete
    union of both capability families
```

Opening or building the project without an explicit property defaults to `Complete` for development.
Canonical product builds must set `UltraSimEdition` exactly; the repository verifier publishes each
edition into an isolated directory and inspects its `.deps.json` and copied assemblies. Build-time
composition is the security/capability boundary. The matching export-preset feature is only a
startup consistency check.

Linux exports use:

```bash
Client/Godot/export-client.sh SinglePlayer
Client/Godot/export-client.sh Online
Client/Godot/export-client.sh Complete
```

The Online preset excludes bundled `Assets/**`. Actual passive-content acquisition remains owned by
the later asset-streaming checkpoints.

For normal development, open this directory in Godot and run the Complete build. Choose **Single
Player** to enter the Concept Demo island. Runtime diagnostics show the configured render radius and
the authored/resident/rendered chunk counts; intentional-void chunks have no mesh, so a larger
window can change the counts without adding visible geometry at the current location.

Local saves live below `user://single-player/`. Controls are shown in the in-session HUD: F1/F2/F3
select movement profiles; F1 single-click selects, hold steers, and double-clicking ground creates a
destination; WASD moves in direct profiles; E interacts with the selected target; Space jumps in
direct profiles; and the mouse wheel adjusts supported camera profiles. The Central Island welcome sign exposes a local `Sign`
hover from resident presentation state; select it and press E to open its authoritative
informational view, then use the view's Close action to dismiss it.
