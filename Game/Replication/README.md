# Game replication

Status: Network N0.1 canonical projection/capture and OfflineDirect oracle accepted.
Packet framing, delivery, security, connection state, and sockets remain later N0
checkpoints.

`Game/Replication` is the game-owned seam between committed authoritative state
and Network delivery. It depends on the concrete game composition and Runtime;
`Kernels/Network` remains independent of ECS, Game, Server, UI, and Client.

## Ownership

The service never exposes an `Entity` in its output. Runtime entities are used
only while borrowing one callback-scoped generation. Published identity is a
`ReplicationEntityId`, stable for every recipient within one `StateEpoch`.
Generation replacement creates a new epoch and rebuilds canonical truth.

`ParticipantId` remains game/session identity. Account-backed Admission sessions
rebind through durable character identity after publication. Accountless sessions
are explicitly invalidated. Projection bindings are refreshed from that Admission
authority; they do not retain stale ECS handles as authorization.

## Capture contract

The network-enabled game profile reserves ECS lifecycle history, the canonical
main structural merge arena, exact changed-row observation, and a bounded input
RangeJob. The local profile reserves none of the replication/lifecycle machinery.

A capture reads complete committed ECS state only after a Runtime step. It stages
all lifecycle and changed-value work, then publishes canonical slots and advances
cursors together. Before commit:

- scratch/capacity exhaustion returns `CapacityExceeded` without cursor advance;
- lost ECS lifecycle history returns `LifecycleResyncRequired` and requires a
  baseline;
- an expected rebuild never escapes the trusted Runtime callback;
- an unexpected derived-state exception is caught inside the callback and faults
  the projection, not authoritative Runtime.

Every committed create, destroy, add, and remove remains ordered lifecycle
evidence. Values may coalesce. A rapid remove/add or create/destroy between
captures therefore retains both topology facts while canonical state folds to the
final committed state.

Projection lifecycle uses an overwriting fixed ring because a scoped baseline can
recover it. Explicit application events use a non-overwriting fixed ring because
their intermediate occurrence may matter. Full application-event retention
rejects without mutation until a consumer-safe prefix is discarded.

## OfflineDirect

`OfflineDirectGameProjection` is the packet-free semantic oracle. Baselines and
frames stage into fixed private arrays and publish only after complete epoch,
frame, sequence, entity, participant, and capacity validation. It receives no ECS
world or runtime entity authority. Its canonical hash and `NetworkSemanticTrace`
are the reference meaning later ProtocolLoopback and UDP paths must reproduce.

## Authoritative ingress

Preselected external commands enter a fixed game-owned arena and execute through
one serial `RangeJob` in the Input stage. Admission resolves `ParticipantId` to
the current controlled entity before publication. Duplicate/stale client
sequences reject. Value work uses prepared lookups; add/remove/retire operations
use the scheduler structural writer and become visible at the post-graph barrier.

This is not a public untrusted wire decoder. Later Network layers authenticate,
bound, decode, and translate input before calling this game seam.

## N0.1 evidence

The focused executable proves:

- local/network capacity separation;
- canonical baseline and OfflineDirect atomic publication;
- independent exact changed consumers;
- bounded input and duplicate-sequence rejection;
- same-tick post-graph add/remove/destroy capture;
- rapid membership folding and ordered lifecycle history;
- transactional capacity failure and cursor non-acknowledgement;
- lifecycle overflow/resync and explicit rebuild;
- derived projection fault containment;
- bounded independent application events;
- atomic invalid-frame rejection;
- accountless invalidation and durable account-backed rebind across generation
  replacement;
- deterministic canonical hash/semantic trace;
- zero warmed caller-thread allocation for tick + capture + OfflineDirect apply.

It also exposed and fixed a scheduler regression in which a second-tick typed
structural `Add<T>` copied payload before opening the canonical command-buffer
epoch. The ECS scheduler suite now owns a direct cross-tick regression test.

The accepted 100K profile records 100K changed rows per step. On the acceptance
machine, canonical capture averaged 5.84 ms (58.4 ns/entity), OfflineDirect apply
averaged 2.12 ms (21.2 ns/entity), and timed caller allocation was zero. The
benchmark's 91.2 MB OfflineDirect reservation deliberately retains the semantic
trace for every warmup/sample frame; it is evidence capacity, not a recommended
per-client production profile. See the immutable
[N0.1 artifact](../../_Benchmarks/Baselines/network-n0.1-game-projection-100k-2026-08-14.json).

dotnet run --project _Benchmarks/UltraSim.Game.ReplicationBenchmarks -c Release

N0.2 is next: dependency-clean Network kernel capacities, generational connection
state, packet/slab ownership, bounded rings, strict framing, and generated codecs.
